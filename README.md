# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
Menu:
The web application supports all of the available menu items for Pinnochio’s Pizza & Subs (a popular pizza place in Cambridge). This is done by providing separate fields for type of food (i.e.: regular pizzas, pasta, subs, etc ), sizes (small or regular or large), cost, name and toppings allowed, in a model called Food.

Adding Items:
Using Django Admin, site administrators (restaurant owners) can add, update, and remove items on the menu.

Registration, Login, Logout:
 Site users (customers) can register for the web application with a username, password, first name, last name, and email address. Customers should then be able to log in and log out of your website.

Shopping Cart:
Once logged in, users see a representation of the restaurant’s menu, where they can add items (along with toppings or extras, if appropriate) to their virtual “shopping cart.” The contents of the shopping are saved even if a user closes the window, or logs out and logs back in again.

Placing an Order:
Once there is at least one item in a user’s shopping cart, they can place an order, whereby the user is asked to confirm the items in the shopping cart, and the total (no need to worry about tax!) before placing an order.

Viewing Orders:
Site administrators have access to a page where they can view any orders that have already been placed.

Status:
Users can view the status of the orders that they have placed and site administrators can update the status on the admin page in the Orders model.
